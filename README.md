<b>💡Inspiration💡</b>
International students often have a very hard time figuring things out when going on campus. Travel and meeting new friends is one of the most difficult parts of going to University Internationally.


<b>❓What it does❓</b>
UniPort helps resolve this, by creating an organized, integrated plan for students based on their schedule, and gives them directions on how to meet and organize meetings with Friends.


<b>🔨How we built it🔨</b>
I used React Native to Build this Application. I also planned on using SQL to store all of the server data and Google Maps API for path recognition and put this API into an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.


<b>💔Challenges we ran into💔</b>
One of the challenges I ran into was there wasn't enough time to bring my idea to fruition. I think working in an aggregate team group of 3-4 people would be more helpful than 1, to dedicate people to different areas, and achieve up to 4x as much work in the same period of time. I had some problems integrating libraries in react as well as integrating the MapAPI as well as segues.


<b>🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of🏆</b>
Although I was far-fetched from finishing the project, I have learned the basis of ReactJS, and Moqups, as well as created 2 applications of a Tesla Page following a YouTube Tutorial and Integrated React Native Ionicon Libraries.


<b>🎓What we learned🎓</b>
Today, I learned you can't build an impressive Minimum Viable Product and learn an entire framework in less than 24 hours. It's more useful to come in with more general knowledge on the framework first, then find people that fit your skills accordingly. I also learned a lot about the React.js Framework and SQL.


<b>❓What's next for UniPort❓</b>
I will translate my skills that I have amassed from this Hackathon for the next Hack in 2 weeks, by creating another ReactJS Application.


<b>💙Built With JavaScript and React Native💙</b>
